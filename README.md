✨ Built with [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) for optimal development experience ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

## Quick Start

### Single Player Mode

1. Start the development server:
```sh
npx nx serve go-game
```

2. Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser

### Multiplayer Mode

1. Start the PartyKit server:
```sh
cd apps/go-game-partykit
npx partykit dev
```

2. In another terminal, start the frontend:
```sh
npx nx serve go-game
```

3. Open http://localhost:4200 and click "Switch to Multiplayer"

### Production Build

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build go-game
```

### API Backend (Optional)

The project includes a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for user authentication and game persistence:

```sh
# Start the API server
npx nx serve go-game-api

# MongoDB required for full functionality
# Set MONGODB_URI in environment variables
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

npx nx build go-game
# Deploy dist/apps/go-game to your hosting service
```

#### PartyKit Server (Cloudflare)
```bash
cd apps/go-game-partykit
npx partykit deploy
```

#### Backend API
Can be deployed to any Node.js hosting service (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.):
- Ensure MongoDB connection is configured
- Set environment variables
- Run `npm run build` and start with `node dist/apps/go-game-api/main.js`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
