# Go Game Development Session - Today's Changes

## Session Summary

Today's session focused on ensuring all game control buttons are working properly and documenting the complete implementation. The game is now fully functional with all features implemented.

## Verification Completed

### Game Control Buttons Status

All buttons in the game have been verified to be properly connected and functional:

1. **Pass Button** ✅

   - Connected via `onPass` prop in GameControls
   - Calls `gameEngine.makeMove(currentPlayer, MoveType.PASS)`
   - Shows notification when player passes
   - Two consecutive passes trigger scoring phase

2. **Resign Button** ✅

   - Connected via `onResign` prop in GameControls
   - Calls `gameEngine.makeMove(currentPlayer, MoveType.RESIGN)`
   - Shows game over notification with winner
   - Properly ends the game

3. **Start New Game Button** ✅

   - Connected via `onNewGame` prop in GameControls
   - Creates fresh game engine instance
   - Resets board to initial state
   - Shows new game notification

4. **Scoring Phase Controls** ✅
   - Finalize Game button properly connected
   - Resume Playing button allows returning to game
   - Dead stone marking works by clicking stones

## Key Implementation Details

### Button Flow Architecture

```
Game Component (libs/game/src/lib/components/Game.tsx)
  ├── handlePass() → gameEngine.makeMove(PASS)
  ├── handleResign() → gameEngine.makeMove(RESIGN)
  ├── handleNewGame() → new GameEngine instance
  └── Passes callbacks to → GameControls Component
```

### GameControls Component Features

- Dynamic button visibility based on game phase
- Disabled state handling
- Visual feedback with icons (Tabler icons)
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Color-coded game status indicators

### Notification System

Each action triggers appropriate notifications:

- Pass: Blue notification "Player passed"
- Resign: Red notification "Player resigned. Winner wins!"
- New Game: Green notification "Starting a fresh game"
- Scoring Phase: Yellow notification with instructions

## Technical Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
App
└── Game (Main game container)
    ├── GoBoard (Board rendering and interaction)
    ├── GameControls (Pass, Resign, New Game buttons)
    └── ScoringControls (Scoring phase UI)
```

### State Management

- Game engine holds authoritative state
- React components use forced re-renders for updates
- Notifications provide user feedback
- No state synchronization issues

## Testing Features

- Development-only test mode toggle
- Pre-configured scoring scenario
- Easy verification of all game phases

## Next Steps (Future Sprints)

1. **Sprint 2: AI Opponent**

   - Basic AI with random legal moves
   - Difficulty levels
   - AI move visualization

2. **Sprint 3: Advanced Features**

   - Game history/replay
   - Save/load games
   - Online multiplayer
   - Tournament modes

3. **Sprint 4: Polish**
