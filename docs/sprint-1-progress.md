## Technical Decisions Made

1. **State Management**: Using game engine as single source of truth
2. **UI Library**: Mantine UI for consistent, modern components
3. **Styling**: CSS Modules with theme system
4. **Architecture**: Clean separation between game logic and UI
5. **Testing**: Development test mode for easy verification

## Blockers Resolved

- ✅ TypeScript configuration issues
- ✅ Import/export path problems
- ✅ React component integration
- ✅ Scoring phase implementation
- ✅ Button connectivity verification

## Definition of Done Checklist

- ✅ All user stories completed
- ✅ Code reviewed and refactored
- ✅ No critical bugs
- ✅ Responsive design implemented
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ All features working end-to-end

## Sprint Retrospective
