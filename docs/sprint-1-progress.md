# Sprint 1: Core Game Engine Foundation

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Build the foundational game engine with core GO rules, board representation, and TypeScript interfaces.

## 📚 Created Libraries Structure

### ✅ Shared Libraries

- `@aim-to-code/types` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `@aim-to-code/constants` - Game constants (board sizes, colors, etc.)
- `@aim-to-code/utils` - Common utility functions
- `@aim-to-code/shared` - General shared code

### ✅ Game Libraries

- `@aim-to-code/game` - Core game engine and logic

## 📋 Task Breakdown

### **Task 1: ✅ Project Structure Setup**

- [x] Create shared libraries (types, constants, utils)
- [x] Create game engine library
- [x] Setup NX workspace structure

### **Task 2: ✅ Core Types & Interfaces**

- [x] Define GO game core types
- [x] Board representation interfaces
- [x] Player and move types
- [x] Game state management types

### **Task 3: ✅ Game Constants**

- [x] Board size constants (9x9, 13x13, 19x19)
- [x] Game phase enums
- [x] Player colors and stone types
- [x] Scoring constants

### **Task 4: ✅ Core Game Engine**

- [x] Board state management
- [x] Move validation logic
- [x] Capture detection algorithm
- [x] Ko rule enforcement
- [x] Pass/Resign handling

### **Task 5: 📅 Game Logic Testing**

- [ ] Unit tests for move validation
- [ ] Capture detection tests
- [ ] Ko rule tests
- [ ] Game state transition tests

## 🎯 Sprint 1 Definition of Done

- [x] All GO game core types defined
- [x] Board state representation working
- [x] Basic move validation implemented
- [x] Capture detection working
- [x] Ko rule enforcement implemented
- [ ] Unit tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [x] Documentation complete

## 🔧 Tech Stack Dependencies (To Install)

- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [ ] Jest for testing
- [ ] Additional type utilities if needed

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on pure game logic (no UI yet)
- All functions should be pure/functional
- Comprehensive TypeScript typing
- Test-driven development approach

## ✅ Completed Work Summary

### Types Library (`@go-game/types`)

- ✅ Complete type system for GO game (Player, GamePhase, BoardSize, etc.)
- ✅ Board representation types (Board, Position, Stone, StoneGroup)
- ✅ Move and game action types (Move, MoveResult, CaptureResult)
- ✅ Game state management types (GameState, GameScore, Territory)
- ✅ Utility types and helper functions

### Constants Library (`@go-game/constants`)

- ✅ Board size configurations and star points
- ✅ Scoring constants (komi, capture points)
- ✅ Time control presets (blitz, rapid, normal, correspondence)
- ✅ Visual theme constants (classic, modern, zen)
- ✅ Game rules constants (handicap, error messages)
- ✅ WebSocket events and API constants

### Utils Library (`@go-game/utils`)

- ✅ Board manipulation utilities (create, clone, get/set intersections)
- ✅ Position and group utilities (adjacency, liberties, capture detection)
- ✅ Move validation utilities (suicide check, Ko rule check)
- ✅ Game state utilities (ID generation, distance calculations, position formatting)

### Game Engine Library (`@go-game/game`)

- ✅ **GameEngine class** - Complete game state management and rule enforcement
- ✅ **Move execution** - Stone placement, pass, resign with full validation
- ✅ **Capture detection** - Automatic stone capture and Ko rule enforcement
- ✅ **Game state validation** - Ensures game state integrity
- ✅ **Game factory utilities** - Easy creation of standard game configurations
- ✅ **Immutable game state** - Safe access to game state without mutation
