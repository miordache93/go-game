# Sprint 1: Core Game Engine Foundation

## 🎯 Sprint Goal

Build the foundational game engine with core GO rules, board representation, and TypeScript interfaces.

## 📚 Created Libraries Structure

### ✅ Shared Libraries

- [ ] Test-driven development approach (pending)

## ✅ Completed Work Summary

### Types Library (`@go-game/types`)

- ✅ Complete type system for GO game (Player, GamePhase, BoardSize, etc.)
- ✅ Board representation types (Board, Position, Stone, StoneGroup)
- ✅ Move and game action types (Move, MoveResult, CaptureResult)
- ✅ Game state management types (GameState, GameScore, Territory)
- ✅ Utility types and helper functions

### Constants Library (`@go-game/constants`)

- ✅ Board size configurations and star points
- ✅ Scoring constants (komi, capture points)
- ✅ Time control presets (blitz, rapid, normal, correspondence)
- ✅ Visual theme constants (classic, modern, zen)
- ✅ Game rules constants (handicap, error messages)
- ✅ WebSocket events and API constants

### Utils Library (`@go-game/utils`)

- ✅ Board manipulation utilities (create, clone, get/set intersections)
- ✅ Position and group utilities (adjacency, liberties, capture detection)
- ✅ Move validation utilities (suicide check, Ko rule check)
